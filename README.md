## Features

- Object detection using YOLOv8 model
- Polygon definition for filtering objects inside polygons
- Interactive annotation for precise object identification
- User-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) using Pyside6
- Efficient and accurate object recognition

## Requirements

Before using Poly-Shield-Detector, make sure you have the following:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Pyside6
- torch
- ultralytics
- shapely

## Preparation

Before running Poly-Shield-Detector, make sure to perform the following preparation steps:

- Place the YOLOv8 model file in the `models` folder.
- Create the `records` folder to store the detected objects and polygon information.
- Create the `output` folder to store the processed images.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/yihong1120/Poly-Shield-Detector.git
cd Poly-Shield-Detector
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Run the `app.py` file:

```shell
python app.py
```

2. Select an image file using the "Upload Image" button.
3. Define polygons by clicking on the image.
4. Click the "Predict" button to perform object detection.
5. View the detected objects in the list on the right-hand side.
6. To clear the polygons and start over, click the "Clear Lists" button.
